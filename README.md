# Rottomation-Mastodon

This project is part of my rottomation project found [here](https://github.com/i0gg2n38c/rottomation)

This project will be a testbed where I implement my rottomation project as a gem and leverage it for Mastodon testing.

## Why?
Mastodon is open source, available to self host, and provides a lot of other instances online to work with. In other words: It's an easy, well documented project that I can use to flush out rottomation into something more, all while being a sound test bed to experiment with different testing patterns and designs.

## End Goal:
I hope to get full end-to-end testing of the Mastodon API and frontend through this. Leveraging rottomation's wrapper around Selenium to validate the UI processing and handling data via the API, I hope to eventually leverage this to write up bugs and improve the platform as a whole.

## Where it's at now?
Just starting ðŸ˜Ž

Eventually this will flush out into something bigger. But for now, it'll be the test bed that helps me determine what is missing in Rottomation.
